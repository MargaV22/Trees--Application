2. Educational Purpose: Demonstrates the use of tree structures in a real-world scenario.
3. Foundation for Expansion: Provides a base for more complex applications, such as resource allocation or performance tracking within departments.


HOW DOES IT CONTRIBUTE YOU OR THE COMMUNITY?

1. Improved Organization: Simplifies managing municipal departments and their relationships.
2. Educational Tool: Introduces tree structures in an easy-to-understand manner, helping students and developers learn hierarchical data modeling.
